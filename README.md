# 👋 Hi, I'm Cyrus!

## 👩🏻‍💻 About<br/>

I'm a Web Developer with **7 years of hands-on experience** in the ever-evolving IT jungle. I've worn many hats — backend ninja, frontend firefighter, DevOps wr...ang...ler??? kind of!? XD — and I still get excited about clean code, efficient systems, and solving problems that make people say “Wow, Bilis ah!” XD

Whether it's **building scalable, modular apps**, **debugging a bug that mysteriously vanishes when I screen share**, or **optimizing websites until they load faster than you can blink**, I'm your guy. XD

I’ve worked across **Linux and Windows**, juggled **CMSes**, integrated **SSO with Azure Entra ID**, and kept deployments smooth with tools like **Docker**, **Git**, and **CI/CD pipelines**. If it lives on the web and occasionally misbehaves — I’ve probably fixed it (or stayed up all night trying). I'm not a nerd, duhh! Ayosin agad at baka makalimotan. Ganern!!! XD

I love collaborating with designers, project managers, and fellow devs — because the best products are built by great teams, not solo heroes. I’m also big on mentoring and sharing what I know (and occasionally what's **not** to do).

If you're looking for someone who’s **technically solid**, **team-friendly**, and **likes to laugh while shipping code**, let’s talk!

🛠️ Tech highlights:
- PHP (Laravel, CodeIgniter), JS, HTML/CSS
- CMS development and API integrations
- Git, Docker, GitLab CI/CD
- AWS, Plesk, Linux/Windows server wrangling
- Performance tuning with PageSpeed, GTMetrix, Pingdom

☕ I love black coffee and I hate **spaghetti**. I prefer **KISS** and making my code **DRY**, and my commit messages... usually readable "Apply Fix and Update". XD
