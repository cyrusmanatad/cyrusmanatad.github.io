# üëã Hi, I'm Cyrus!

## üë©üèª‚Äçüíª About<br/>

I‚Äôm a passionate Web Developer with over 7 years of experience building and supporting web applications that make a real difference for users and businesses.

I love creating clean, reliable, and scalable web solutions using PHP (CodeIgniter, Laravel), JavaScript, MySQL/MariaDB, and modern front-end tools like Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, and ReactJS. Over the years, I‚Äôve worked on projects that involve everything from custom CMS builds and API integrations (REST & SOAP) to Single Sign-On (SSO) setups with Azure Entra ID and LDAP.

I‚Äôm also big on process efficiency, like using Docker, AWS, and GitLab CI/CD to ensure smoother deployments and consistent environments. I enjoy solving technical challenges, mentoring teammates, and improving systems so everything runs faster and smarter.

At the end of the day, I‚Äôm driven by curiosity and the desire to keep learning, whether it‚Äôs exploring new frameworks or finding creative ways to make web apps more intuitive and efficient.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech highlights:
- PHP (Laravel, CodeIgniter), JS, HTML/CSS
- CMS development and API integrations
- Git, Docker, GitLab CI/CD
- AWS, Plesk, Linux/Windows server wrangling
- Performance tuning with PageSpeed, GTMetrix, Pingdom

‚òï I love black coffee and I hate **spaghetti**. I prefer **KISS** and making my code **DRY**, and my commit messages... usually readable "Apply Fix and Update". XD
